## 3. Assembly Steps

**Important:** Carefully follow the instructions and check the photos for each step.

### Step 1: Microcontroller Check (Recommended)
Replacing the microcontroller after soldering is difficult, so check its operation beforehand.

1.  While holding down the Boot button (marked 'B') on the microcontroller, connect it to your PC. If a volume named `RPI-RP2` mounts successfully, it's working.
2.  Download and unzip the .uf2 file from [PRK Firmware Releases](https://github.com/picoruby/prk_firmware/releases).
3.  Drag and drop the .uf2 file onto the `RPI-RP2` volume. If `RPI-RP2` unmounts and `PRK_FIRMWARE` mounts, it's successful.
4.  Download [keymap.rb](./keymap.rb) and drag and drop it onto the `PRK_FIRMWARE` volume.
5.  Using a jumper wire or tweezers, connect the `GND` and `D0` (or just `0`) pins on the microcontroller.
    ![Connect with jumper wire](./images/03-micon-test.jpg)
6.  Confirm that a key press is registered on your PC screen.

### Step 2: Soldering Pin Headers

**Important:** If you solder the microcontroller first, you won't be able to install the key switches. **Solder only the pin headers at this stage.**

1.  Insert the pin headers into the PCB. (Insert two 7-pin headers into the designated rows).
    ![Insert pin headers](./images/04-pinheader1.jpg)
2.  Place the microcontroller onto the pin headers.
    ![Place microcontroller](./images/04-pinheader2.jpg)
3.  Temporarily secure the microcontroller with masking tape.
    ![Secure microcontroller with masking tape](./images/04-pinheader3.jpg)
4.  Solder only the four corner pins of the headers (this makes adjustments easier if it's not sitting flat).
    ![Solder only the four corner pins](./images/04-pinheader4.jpg)
5.  Remove the microcontroller and check if there is any gap between the pin headers and the PCB. Ensure they are flush.
    ![Remove microcontroller and check for gaps](./images/04-pinheader5.jpg)
6.  Solder all the remaining pins.

* Pin header soldering complete! :tada:

### Step 3: Soldering Key Switches
Solder the 5 key switches to the PCB.

1.  Insert a key switch into the PCB. Make sure it sits flat.
    ![Insert key switch](./images/05-switch0.jpg)
2.  Temporarily secure the key switch with masking tape.
    ![Secure key switch with masking tape](./images/05-switch1.jpg)
3.  Solder the key switch pins.
    ![Solder key switch](./images/05-switch3.jpg)
4.  Repeat the process for the other four key switches.
    ![Solder the other four key switches](./images/05-switch4.jpg)

### Step 4: Soldering the Microcontroller
Carefully orient the microcontroller and insert it onto the soldered pin headers, then solder it in place.

1.  Place the microcontroller onto the pin headers, ensuring the orientation is correct (USB port facing outwards).
    ![Place microcontroller](./images/06-micon0.jpg)
2.  (Optional but recommended) Cover the excess length of the pin header legs with masking tape and trim them with nippers.
    * This prevents the cut pins from flying off.
        ![Cover protruding pins with masking tape before cutting with nippers to prevent scattering](./images/06-micon1.jpg)
    * Leave this much length on the pins.
        ![Leave about this much pin length](./images/06-micon2.jpg)
3.  Solder the microcontroller to the pin headers.
    ![Solder microcontroller](./images/06-micon3.jpg)

### Step 5: Attaching the Bottom Plate
1.  Attach the four spacers to the designated holes on the PCB using four M2 screws from the top side.

2.  Place the bottom plate onto the spacers and secure it with the remaining four M2 screws. Finally, attach the rubber feet to the bottom plate.

### Step 6: Attaching Keycaps

1.  Align the keycaps with the stems of the corresponding key switches and press them down firmly.
2.  Once all keycaps are attached, the assembly is complete! :tada:

## 4. Firmware Flashing and Configuration

### About the Firmware
This keyboard runs on [PRK Firmware](https://github.com/picoruby/prk_firmware).

### Flashing Method (If Needed)
Follow these steps to update or flash custom firmware:

1.  Prepare the firmware file (`.rb`) you want to flash.
2.  Connect the keyboard to your PC. It should mount as the `PRK_FIRMWARE` volume.
3.  Drag and drop the `.rb` file onto the `PRK_FIRMWARE` volume.
4.  Press the key switches and confirm that key presses are registered on your PC screen.

## 5. Operation Check

Once assembly and firmware setup are complete, perform a final operation check.

1.  Connect the keyboard to your PC.
2.  Open a text editor (like Notepad).
3.  Press each key sequentially and confirm that the intended input is registered.
    * Are there any unresponsive keys?
    * Are any keys registering unintended characters? (Check keymap settings)

## 6. Afterword

Congratulations! Your "Leanyer Keyboard" is now complete! ðŸŽ‰
Enjoy customizing the keymap to your liking and experiencing a more comfortable keyboard life.

We hope this build guide has been helpful in your keyboard building journey.
